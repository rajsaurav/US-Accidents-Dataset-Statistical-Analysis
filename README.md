# US-Accidents-Dataset-Statistical-Analysis
This file contains analysis of dataset that has 7.7 million records about the US accidents from 2016 - 2023. The exploratory data analysis done using Python visualizes different trends including impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents. This is a countrywide traffic accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the United States. The data is continuously being collected from February 2016, using several data providers, including two APIs which provide streaming traffic event data. These APIs broadcast traffic events captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks.
